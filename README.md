# India Census Data Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing the India Census dataset from the year 2011. The data is stored in a CSV file named `india-districts-census-2011.csv` and is assumed to be located on Kaggle.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

The code utilizes pandas and matplotlib libraries to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create various visualizations to understand the characteristics of the Indian population across districts in 2011.

The key functionalities of the code include:

* **Identifying Missing Values:** Checks for missing values in each column of the dataset.
* **Data Cleaning (Optional):** You can add code to handle missing values (e.g., imputation techniques).
* **Visualizing Distributions:** Creates histograms and KDE plots to explore the distribution of numerical columns like population, workers, etc.
* **Comparing Categories:** Creates bar charts (horizontal and stacked) to compare different categories across districts.
* **Analyzing Relationships:** Creates scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables like male and female literacy rates or population and number of males.
* **Customizable Plots:** Allows customization of plot appearance using features like colors, sizes, and figure size.

## Running the Code

1. **Install Required Libraries:** Make sure you have pandas and matplotlib libraries installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib`).
2. **Download the Dataset:** Download the `india-districts-census-2011.csv` file and place it in the same directory as the code.
3. **Execute the Script:** Run the Python script using a command like `python your_script_name.py`.

## Expected Output

The code will generate various plots, including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, KDE plots, and line plots, providing insights into the population demographics, literacy rates, workforce distribution, educational attainment, and gender distribution across Indian districts.

## Further Exploration

This code provides a foundational analysis of the census data. You can extend this work by:

* Performing more sophisticated data cleaning techniques.
* Creating additional visualizations to focus on specific aspects of the data.
* Implementing statistical analysis to test hypotheses and draw conclusions.
* Building machine learning models to predict or classify data based on various factors.

Feel free to adapt and modify the code to suit your specific research questions and analysis goals.
